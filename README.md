# AVR-Embedded-Software-System
Programming and interfacing LCD, sensors, and controlling motors with Atmega128 MCU, configuring peripherals (e.g. Timers, ADCs, DACs), and applying different controlling mechanisms like (Taskscheduling, RTOS and FSM), using C language.

This was a part of practical caurse work as a team with my colleague [@sallamkhaled]( https://github.com/sallamkhaled?fbclid=IwAR1gxYeSiwcJVSaG1WBGklMRYzdNNklMlCGHIxGjGdsgc3fndWO5EIABv80 )
